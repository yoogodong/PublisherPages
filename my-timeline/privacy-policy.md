# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 2, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how we manage information for the **My Timeline (个人日志)** mobile application (the "App").

### 1. No Data Collection

**My Timeline (个人日志)** is designed as a standalone, offline application.

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    
- **No Device Data:** We do not access or collect device identifiers (IMEI, Android ID), IP addresses, or hardware specifications.
    

### 2. Local Storage Only

All data created or entered by the user within the App is stored **locally** on your device's internal storage.

- We do not have access to your journal entries or logs.
    
- We do not host any cloud servers, and your data is never uploaded to any external infrastructure by this App.
    
- Deleting the App will result in the permanent deletion of all locally stored data.
    

### 3. Third-Party Services

We do **not** integrate any third-party SDKs, including but not limited to:

- Advertising networks (e.g., AdMob).
    
- Analytics services (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics).
    
- Payment processors.
    
- Crash reporting tools.
    

### 4. Permissions

The App may request standard Android permissions required for basic functionality (e.g., storage access to save your logs). These permissions are used exclusively for the App’s operation on your device.

### 5. Children’s Privacy (COPPA)

Our App is **not** directed to children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from children.
